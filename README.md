# Vue MDBootstrap Starter Kit

This starter kit should help you get started developing with **Vue MDBootstrap v2.2** components.
**Bootstrap v5** is used in this starter kit to help you quickly styling the web pages.


## IDE Setup

### Recommended Setup

[VSCode](https://code.visualstudio.com/) + [Vue - Official](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=Vue.volar). 

Learn more about the recommended Project Setup and IDE Support in the [Vue Docs TypeScript Guide](https://vuejs.org/guide/typescript/overview.html#project-setup).


### Type Support for `.vue` Imports in TS

TypeScript cannot handle type information for `.vue` imports by default, so we replace the `tsc` CLI with `vue-tsc` for type checking. In editors, we need [Vue - Official](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=Vue.volar) to make the TypeScript language service aware of `.vue` file types.


## Configuration Adjustment

See [Vite Configuration Reference](https://vitejs.dev/config/).
